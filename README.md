### Project Description

**AI RECIPEMAKER** is a full-stack web application designed to eliminate food waste and inspire your next meal. Users simply input the ingredients they have in their kitchen, and the app uses a powerful AI model like **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (via the Google GenAI SDK) to generate unique, customized, and step-by-step recipes instantly.
